# CI/CD Pipeline Check Order and Summary Requirements

## Optimal Check Order
In a CI/CD pipeline that needs to verify both file changes and version changes, the recommended order is:

1. **Check if files changed first**
2. **Check if version changed second**

### Reasoning Behind This Order
This sequence is optimal for several important reasons:

- **Efficiency**: File change detection is typically faster and computationally less expensive than version comparison
- **Early termination**: If no files have changed, the pipeline can exit early without needing to perform version checks
- **Logical dependency**: Version change verification is only meaningful when actual code or configuration files have changed
- **"Fail fast" pattern**: This approach prevents the pipeline from proceeding further when no meaningful changes exist
- **Prevents empty releases**: Avoids scenarios where a version bump would be approved despite no actual code changes

## Required Summary Information
The CI/CD pipeline summary should always include:

1. **Which files changed**
   - A complete list of modified files
   - Or a meaningful categorization by type/component
   - May include the nature of changes (added, modified, deleted)
   - Must include datetime of each file's last modification

2. **Which two commits are being compared**
   - **Standard case**: Current commit vs. most recent commit
   - **Special cases**:
     - First deployment of a project component
     - Integration of a new workflow into existing infrastructure
     - Baseline comparisons for newly introduced CI/CD workflows
     - Scenarios involving pre-existing Docker containers or images
   - **Must include datetime information** for each commit being compared

### Importance of Commit Comparison Details
The commit comparison information provides critical context for understanding:
- The scope and impact of changes
- The deployment history
- The relationship between new and existing components
- Potential integration points with existing infrastructure

This context is particularly valuable when dealing with complex deployment scenarios or when introducing new workflows to established projects.

## Recommended Table Format for Change Summary

For optimal clarity, organize the file change and commit information in a structured table format:

| File Path | Change Type | Current Commit Version | Current Commit Datetime | Comparison Commit Version | Comparison Commit Datetime |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| /path/to/file1.js | Modified | abc123 | 2025-02-28 14:30:00 UTC | def456 | 2025-02-27 09:15:22 UTC |
| /path/to/file2.css | Added | abc123 | 2025-02-28 14:30:00 UTC | N/A | N/A |
| /path/to/file3.yml | Deleted | N/A | N/A | def456 | 2025-02-27 09:15:22 UTC |

This tabular format provides a comprehensive view that:
- Clearly shows which files have changed and how
- Includes the specific commit hashes for reference
- Provides precise datetime information for each commit
- Handles edge cases like new files or deleted files appropriately
- Makes temporal relationships between changes immediately apparent

For large numbers of files, this table can be supplemented with a summary section that highlights key patterns or provides aggregated statistics about the changes.
